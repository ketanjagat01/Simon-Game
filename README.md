# Simon-Game
I developed a Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to repeat a sequence of tones and colors in an increasingly complex pattern. The game includes a circular console with four large colored buttons, each of which plays a specific tone when pressed. I utilized my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and intuitive user experience. This project showcases my ability to create interactive applications using web technologies.

How to Play

To play the game, simply click on the Start button. The game will then play a sequence of tones and colors, and the player must repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding buttons. Each time the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game will add another step to the sequence, making it progressively more difficult. If the player makes a mistake, the game will end and the player can choose to start again.
